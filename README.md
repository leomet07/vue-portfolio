# My old portfolio, made with client side rendered vue.

## This project is now archived, there is a [nuxt continuation](https://github.com/leomet07/portfoliossr).

### Reasons for fundemntal refactor:
1. Client side rendered apporach was slow to load actual projects and required TWO running servers
2. The backend was only used for one endpoint, yet was still slow.
3. This version could not be parsed by search engines, while the deployed refactor can.
